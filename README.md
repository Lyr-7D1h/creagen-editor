# Ideas

- Art made out of mathematical equations, which are also applied in the artwork
- Vector fields
- Flocking
- coloring
  - different color layers of an image each with a small offset
- 3d space
- randomization
  - different probability distributions (PMFs)
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergeometric_distribution
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution
- add graphs
- Valid QR that is a link to the creation of the plot
- Use music/audio as input for art
  - Use a song as probability distribution

# Roadmap

## Editor:

- Export
- Auto formatting
- Transparent editor
- Save coding projects
- Import code using ID `import('a123487e...')
- Crop, compress and convert dropped images to base64 string
- Typescript support

## Library:

- Reduce svg size (https://www.svgviewer.dev/)
- Treat svg paths as vertex (https://baku89.github.io/pave/guide.html) and allow linear operations on it
- Gcode support
